# Job

I started working as Malware Analyst for GDATA CyberDefense AG in January 2015. My main tasks were writing of detection signatures for GDATA's antivirus products as well as taking care of customer submissions.

From 2022 until March 2024 I was Lead Engineer for the Protection Engineering team and responsible to improve detection and prevention technologies for GDATA's mEDR product. 

Since March 2024 I am Principal Malware Researcher at GDATA. I create internal trainings, assist the PR team with technical knowledge, create infrastructure and tools for hunting new malware and monitoring threats, assist others in blog article creation and write articles myself.

# Ransomware Hunting Team

I was part of the [Ransomware Hunting Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ransomware_Hunting_Team) and contributed mainly with by hunting new ransomware families and finding new variants for known families, e.g., I provided ca 80% of the STOP/DJVU ransomware samples. I also wrote a [STOP/DJVU vaccine](https://github.com/struppigel/STOP-DJVU-Ransomware-Vaccine) based on the analysis of John Parol.
