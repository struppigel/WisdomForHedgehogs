# Wisdom for Hedgehogs

![Hedgehog analysing malware in steampunk setting](hedgehog_corona.png)

Knowledge and education are one of the most valuable commodities in this world. On my path while learning a skill and conquering a field, I always took mental notes which resources would have been useful to make things easier. E.g., 2014 Youtube videos about malware analysis were almost non-existent, despite it being a splendid platform to showcase analysis approaches.

Hence, I started to [create Youtube videos myself](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVFXrUwuWxNlm6UNZtBLJ-A). These were of low quality in the beginning, but I figured I will learn and improve on the way. My videos in turn inspired others to do the same, among others [OALabs](https://www.youtube.com/@OALABS/videos) and [Michael Gillespie](https://www.youtube.com/@Demonslay335/videos). That was indeed one of the greatest things I could wish for to happen -- that my work would inspire others to share their knowledge too, so they improve availability of educational resources and inspire people themselves.

That could have been it, however, at some point I ended up watching old videos of myself just to remember how I solved a certain problem in the past. After I did this for the third time, I finally started taking actual notes which I will convert to publicly available articles over time.

## Content

The most interesting section for you are probably the Reversing Tips. It will be filled over time.

The essays and guides section as well as the malware articles section contain external articles which I wrote for GDATA Techblog.

## FAQ

I often get questions via Twitter, Youtube and Reddit DMs. Here are the most frequent ones.

### Why hedgehogs?

So far the resources for hedgehog reversers are very sparse, almost non-existant. That needs to change.

### How should I start learning malware analysis?

I plan to create an article about that. In the meantime, please check [this article by Fabian Wosar](https://github.com/fwosar/malware-analysis-resources)

### Do I need a degree / certs to become a malware analyst?

No, you don't need it. It might help to get the foot in the door but it is more important that you actually have reversing skills.

### Can you decrypt STOP/DJVU ransomware encrypted files?

This is in most cases not possible. Please check first at [id-ransomware](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/) if it is really STOP/DJVU ransomware by uploading a ransom note and an encrypted file. The site will also tell you if you have a chance to decrypt files without paying criminals.

### Can you decrypt other ransomware encrypted files?

This site will tell you: [id-ransomware](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/)
