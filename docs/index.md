# Wisdom for Hedgehogs

![Hedgehog analysing malware in steampunk setting](hedgehog_corona.png)

Knowledge and education are one of the most valuable commodities in this world. On my path while learning a skill and conquering a field, I always took mental notes which resources would have been useful to make things easier. E.g., 2014 Youtube videos about malware analysis were almost non-existent, despite it being a splendid platform to showcase analysis approaches.

Hence, I started to [create Youtube videos myself](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVFXrUwuWxNlm6UNZtBLJ-A). These were of low quality in the beginning, but I figured I will learn and improve on the way. My videos in turn inspired others to do the same, among others [OALabs](https://www.youtube.com/@OALABS/videos) and [Michael Gillespie](https://www.youtube.com/@Demonslay335/videos). That was indeed one of the greatest things I could wish for to happen -- that my work would inspire others to share their knowledge too, so they improve availability of educational resources and inspire people themselves.

That could've been the end of it, however, at some point I felt the need to watch old videos of myself just to recall how I solved a certain problem in the past. After the third time of doing this, I finally started taking notes, some of which I am sharing here.

## Content

The most interesting section for you are probably the Reversing Tips. 

The essays and guides section as well as the malware articles section contain external articles which I wrote for GDATA Techblog.

## FAQ

I often get questions via Twitter, Youtube and Reddit DMs. Here are the most frequent ones.

### Why hedgehogs?

So far the resources for hedgehog reversers are very sparse, almost non-existant. That needs to change.

### How should I start learning malware analysis?

I created a course for beginners, which you find on [Udemy here](https://www.udemy.com/course/windows-malware-analysis-for-hedgehogs-beginner-training/?referralCode=EE0E2DC9FA7388FF25B7)

### Do I need a degree / certs to become a malware analyst?

No, you don't need it. It might help to get the foot in the door but it is more important that you actually have reverse engineering skills.
