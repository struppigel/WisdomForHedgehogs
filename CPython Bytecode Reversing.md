# CPython Reversing - Decompilers, Disassemblers, Assemblers

When decompiling CPython bytecode, you need to make sure that the decompiler supports the CPython version

## Decompilers and supported Python versions

The most versatile decompiler is probably uncompyle6.

## Disassembler

Most decompilers also have disassembly support but there are some dedicated disassemblers.

* [dis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html) is part of Python, supports the currently installed python version
* [python-xdis](https://github.com/rocky/python-xdis), supports 1.0 - 3.10, does not rely on installed Python version

ðŸ”—[Python Bytecode Instructions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#python-bytecode-instructions)

The disassembler is especially useful if premade tools/decompilers fail to extract anything.

**Inspecting objects:**

```python
import rich
import malwaremodule
rich.inspect(malwarefunction)
```

**Disassembly:**

```python
import dis
import malwaremodule
dis.dis(malwarefunction)
```

## Assembler

[python-xasm](https://github.com/rocky/python-xasm), for making small patches to existing bytecode
