# CPython Reversing - Decompilers, Disassemblers, Assemblers

When decompiling CPython bytecode, you need to make sure that the decompiler supports the CPython version

## Decompilers and supported Python versions

The most versatile decompiler is probably uncompyle6.

## Disassembler

Most decompilers also have disassembly support but there are some dedicated disassemblers.

* [dis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html) is part of Python, supports the currently installed python version
* [python-xdis](https://github.com/rocky/python-xdis), supports 1.0 - 3.10, does not rely on installed Python version

## Assembler

[python-xasm](https://github.com/rocky/python-xasm), for making small patches to existing bytecode
