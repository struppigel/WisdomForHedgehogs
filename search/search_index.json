On my path while learning a skill and conquering a field, I always took mental notes which resources would have been useful to make things easier. E.g., 2014 Youtube videos about malware analysis were almost non-existent, despite it being a splendid platform to showcase analysis approaches.</p> <p>Hence, I started to create Youtube videos myself. These were of low quality in the beginning, but I figured I will learn and improve on the way. My videos in turn inspired others to do the same, among others OALabs and Michael Gillespie. That was indeed one of the greatest things I could wish for to happen -- that my work would inspire others to share their knowledge too, so they improve availability of educational resources and inspire people themselves.</p> <p>That could have been it, however, at some point I ended up watching old videos of myself just to remember how I solved a certain problem in the past. After I did this for the third time, I finally started taking actual notes which I will convert to publicly available articles over time.</p>"},{"location":"#content","title":"Content","text":"<p>The most interesting section for you are probably the Reversing Tips.
